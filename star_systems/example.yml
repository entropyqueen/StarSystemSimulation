  # dt is the time interval between each iteration of the simulation
  # since we are integrating the position through time, the higher the dt, the higher the error margin
  # however, a really small dt will make the simulation really slow.
  # It is expressed using the time unit in the yaml file
  # if not specified, we use SIM_DT in config.py

# Units are used to specify dimensions in the yaml file
# units are from https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html
# use adequate types of units or things will break ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
